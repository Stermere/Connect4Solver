TheConnector
=======

This project is a relatively simple Connect4 solver that runs in the terminal. The player that goes first does win by force so if you go second the game is already over!
You can easily compile it with the make file to produce the executable binary TheConnector.exe or download it from the releases here on GitHub.
Make sure to run it with the 5-move opening book in the same directory, otherwise, you'll have to wait a minute or two for the first move.
